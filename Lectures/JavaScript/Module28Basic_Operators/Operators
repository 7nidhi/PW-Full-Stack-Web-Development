Lesson : Operators in JavaScript Part 1

Operators and Operands: Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform actions or operations on one or more operands (data values).
Arithmetic Operators: These include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**). They operate on numerical values to perform basic mathematical calculations.
Increment and Decrement Operators: These operators (++, --) are used to increase or decrease the value of variables by one, either before or after their use in expressions.
Assignment Operator: The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. Compound assignment operators (like +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=) combine arithmetic operations with assignment.
Comparison Operators: These operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false) based on the comparison result.
Logical Operators: Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to combine conditional statements and return true or false. && (AND) returns true if both operands are true. || (OR) returns true if at least one operand is true. ! (NOT) returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.
Unary Operators: These operate on a single operand to perform various actions. Examples include unary plus (+) and unary negation (-), which convert values to numbers and change their signs, respectively
