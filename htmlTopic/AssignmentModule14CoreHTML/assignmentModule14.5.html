    <h3>Desription Of Full Stack Web Development Tech Stack</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>LAMP</dt>
        <dd>LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:
        </dd>
        <dt>ASP.NET</dt>
        <dd>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux.

        </dd>
        <dt>MEAN</dt>
        <dd>
            One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web developers.
            MEAN consists of-MongoDB (NoSQL database),Express.js backend web framework,Angular.js frontend framework,Node.js server-side JavaScript
        </dd>
        <dt>MERN</dt>
        <dd>
            Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.
            The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
        </dd>
        <dt>MEVN</dt>
        <dd>Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.

        </dd>
        <dt>Ruby On Rails</dt>
        <dd>
            Ruby on Rails is a programming environment that uses Ruby, a dynamic programming language. With RoR, you can simplify the entire development process.
            A server-side web app development written in the Ruby programming language requires less knowledge to work on
        </dd>
        <dt>Python</dt>
        <dd>
            Python has also become very popular because of its heavy usage for machine learning and data science. It can also be used for building web applications by using the popular Django web framework.
        </dd>
        <dt>Java</dt>
        <dd>
            Java is still heavily used and there are lots of Java developers all over the world.
